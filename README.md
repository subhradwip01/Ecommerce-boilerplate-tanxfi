### Functionalities
  - Signup
  - Login
  - View All Products
  - Add to Cart
  - Place Order
  - Add to Favourites
  - Search for products
  - View Details of The Product

### Improvements
  - Code Quality - For a few areas I am repeating the codes. To make it production-ready, we should improve the code quality
  - Debounce Effect - While searching each keyword press it is filtering out which is not efficient and CPU consuming so I can use the debounce effect
  - User Input check - currently do not have any checking condition for user input. I can add it like in Login Form or Signup form

### What would you do differently if you were allocated more time?
- Enhance UI
- Improve web security to prevent attacks like DDOS
- Create own design system for smoother development
- Add features like order tracking, and sections in favorites - like creating Man, Women
- Create a Profile section
- Sorting features like - price low to high and high to low
- Rating functionality for the products
